* Tagging new or existing assets in your data center to start receiving real-time updates.
* Performing rack asset audits in Hyperview.
* Detecting asset moves across racks and locations and automatically updating corresponding records.
* Auditing assets to address placement collisions.
* Scanning asset tags using a barcode scanner to quickly populate relevant fields.
