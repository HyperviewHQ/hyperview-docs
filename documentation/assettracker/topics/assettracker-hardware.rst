*********************

The AssetTracker RFID solution is currently certified on |Digitalor| asset tracking hardware. However, the product is vendor-agnostic and can be tested and certified on additional asset-tracking hardware systems. We encourage vendors to contact Hyperview if they are interested in having their asset-tracking hardware system certified for use with the AssetTracker RFID solution.
