# AssetTracker hardware

The AssetTracker RFID solution is currently certified on [Digitalor](https://www.digitalor.com/en/) asset tracking hardware. However, the product is vendor-agnostic and can be tested and certified on additional asset-tracking hardware systems. We encourage vendors to contact Hyperview if they are interested in having their asset-tracking hardware system certified for use with the AssetTracker RFID solution.

The hardware models supported are:

1. The V6800 AIoT Gateway (MQTT) with support for up to 24 racks
2. The V5008MQ Smart Gateway (MQTT) with support for up to 5 racks
