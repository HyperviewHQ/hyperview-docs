Integrations

Hyperview APIs are documented from within the product and on the Hyperview Documentation site. Customers are free to write their integrations and there are API integration samples provided on `GitHub <https://github.com/HyperviewHQ/API-Samples>`_.

In addition to open APIs, Hyperview offers separately licensed integrations that let you push or pull data from external systems such as `ServiceNow <https://www.servicenow.com/>`_.

.. note:: Only licensed instances will have relevant features. To confirm if you have a license for an integration, check the License page (*Settings â†’ License*, Administrator-only).
