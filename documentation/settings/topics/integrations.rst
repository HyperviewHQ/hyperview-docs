Hyperview comes with a few standard integrations that are built into either the main platform or the Data Collector.

- GoogleMaps APIs for address lookups and map-related visualization
- AccuWeather APIs for weather forecast and alarms
- VMware vSphere APIs for virtual machine discovery

Hyperview APIs are documented from within the product and on the Hyperview Documentation site. Customers are free to write their integrations and there are API integration samples provided on `GitHub <https://github.com/HyperviewHQ/API-Samples>`_.

In addition to open APIs, Hyperview offers separately licensed integrations that let you push or pull data from external systems such as `ServiceNow <https://www.servicenow.com/>`_.

.. note:: Only licensed instances will have relevant features. To confirm if you have a license for an integration, check the License page (*Settings â†’ License*, Administrator-only).
